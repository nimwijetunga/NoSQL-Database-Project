# NoSQL-Database-Project (Work in Progress)

Simple library database which employs the use of NoSQL (non-relational databases). Users can be added to a real-time database hosted by firebase. Features include updating/adding users (deleting to be implemented soon) and querying users using key words. Upon finishing the query, the location of a certain user can be displayed (based on their address) using the Google Geocode API.

## Skills Explored

* Storing and Retrieving Data from a Real-Time Database
* Using Asynchronous Functions in JS (Promises and Callbacks)
* Converting JavaScript objects to elements in HTML (i.e creating an HTML Table in JS)
* Google API Implementation
